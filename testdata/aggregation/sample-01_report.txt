Bismark report for: small_01_R1_val_1.fq.gz and small_01_R2_val_2.fq.gz (version: v0.18.2)
Bismark was run with Bowtie 2 against the bisulfite genome of /cromwell-executions/call_bismark/aae9dbfd-9025-460a-b951-96a0f6fb31ce/call-step1_bismark_wgbs/execution/bismark_index/ with the specified options: -q --score-min L,0,-0.2 --ignore-quals --no-mixed --no-discordant --dovetail --maxins 500
Option '--directional' specified (default mode): alignments to complementary strands (CTOT, CTOB) were ignored (i.e. not performed)

Final Alignment report
======================
Sequence pairs analysed in total:	9955
Number of paired-end alignments with a unique best hit:	303
Mapping efficiency:	3.0% 
Sequence pairs with no alignments under any condition:	9086
Sequence pairs did not map uniquely:	566
Sequence pairs which were discarded because genomic sequence could not be extracted:	0

Number of sequence pairs with unique best (first) alignment came from the bowtie output:
CT/GA/CT:	163	((converted) top strand)
GA/CT/CT:	0	(complementary to (converted) top strand)
GA/CT/GA:	0	(complementary to (converted) bottom strand)
CT/GA/GA:	140	((converted) bottom strand)

Number of alignments to (merely theoretical) complementary strands being rejected in total:	0
